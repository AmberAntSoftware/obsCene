Change init functions to return error enum values instead of pointer checks for consistency



API Problem: containers cannot allocate more than the physical memory even on 64bit
	TODO FIXME:  Add in a supercontainer for linked data for DMA -- aka "list" of data



Missing Containers: Tree(s), Hashmap(s), Set(s)





Initialization should not touch main memory as part of API structure for free initilization on INIT calls
	Offenders: allocfast, allocfastbit
		>Also containers that depend on this offend



Names and schemes need to be corrected





Missing API calls or incorrect headers to API




Allocators need to be heavily refactored with above issues





Issue of UB with allocator definitions is concerning, refactor and investigate
